# Wollok Learning Journey

Welcome to my Wollok learning repository! In this repo, I will document my journey learning the Wollok programming language through examples, exercises, and notes.

## Introduction to Wollok
Wollok is a programming language designed to be simple and educational. It is great for learning programming concepts and object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Setting Up Wollok
To get started with Wollok, follow these steps:

1. Install Wollok from the official website: [Wollok Installation Guide](https://wollok.org)
2. Set up your environment for running Wollok code.

## First Example: Hello World
Here’s a simple "Hello, World!" example to get started.








"Hello, World!" print.

## Variables and Data Types

Wollok uses variables to store values. Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, text, and more!

Here’s how you can declare and print variables:

```wollok
number := 10.
text := "Wollok is awesome!".
number print.    "Prints: 10"
text print.      "Prints: Wollok is awesome!"
Notice that the := is used to assign values to variables. Easy, right?
```
